# Distributed Systems

This repository contains my solutions to the infamous [`MIT 6.824 2017 Course`](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html) on `Distributed Systems`.

- The primary aim of this project is to learn about distributed systems by implementing all the proposed algorithms. Though they might not be used directly in applications today, they form a good base to get started.
- This repository also migrates all the labs from `Go 1.7` to the lastest `Go 1.21` and in the process restructures the code and project to improve readibility and accessibility.
- I also try to add more methods as and when needed to make the code more "pure" and use idiomatic Go as much as I can.
- Each folder has it's own `README.md` which should provide the necessary context about the technique implemented in the same.
- Knowledge of `Go` and it's standard packages like `net`, `rpc`, `io`, `os` etc. is essential for the purpose of the same.
