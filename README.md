# Distributed Systems

This repository contains my solutions to the infamous [`MIT 6.824 2017 Course`](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2017/index.html) on `Distributed Systems`.

- The primary aim of this project is to learn about distributed systems, as well migrate the code of the lab from `Go 1.7` to the lastest `Go 1.21` and in the process restructure the code and project to improve readibility and accessibility.
- Each folder has it's own `README.md` which should provide the necessary context about the technique implemented in the same.
- Knowledge of `Go` and it's standard packages like `net`, `rpc`, `io`, `os` etc. is essential for the purpose of the same.
